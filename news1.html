            <h2>Premium RGB fans and sleek all-around tempered glass panels for clean custom PC builds</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>November 6th, 2017, Keelung, Taiwan – Lian Li Industrial Co. Ltd
               pleased to announce the all-new Alpha series of PC cases. Where Lian Li has traditionally 
               crafted unique, high-quality aluminium PC cases with unique design elements, the Alpha 
               series combines that unique approach to compartmented PC chassis design and combines it 
               with the traditional mono-space PC case. This has created a unique series of mainstream 
               PC cases that feature Lian Li’s inspiring tempered glass panels and liquid cooling potential 
               while preserving the layout of traditional PC builds. The quality still defies industry 
               standards with 1mm thick SECC steel and 4 mm thick tempered glass panels. But, a true 
               tempered glass case is traditionally hard on cable management, that’s why cable management 
               in the Alpha series, with glass panels all-around, is a priority. With cable blinders 
               available all-around, a PSU shroud and two-level transparency glass panels, amazingly 
               clean builds can be made, from mini-ITX to 8-slot Extended ATX motherboards with vertical 
               GPUs. The Lian Li Alpha series are a fresh, new performance and design direction in the PC 
               design industry, with a minimum of protrusions and plastic in order to create a new beacon 
               of light and sleek design in a sea of “gaming” inspired cases.

            <h2>The tempered glass Alpha series</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The long-awaited availability of the Alpha 330 and 550 RGB allows gamers to maximize their 
                good looks thanks to its spacious design and flexibility. From the start, the Alpha series 
                was designed to allow large amount of equipment, be visually appealing and still offer the 
                performance needed. That is why most general cabling can be hidden under many blinders and 
                components can be arranged for showcase builds. The up to 300 mm PSU is hidden out of sight
                with a PSU shroud and tempered glass with two levels of transparency. SSD’s and HDD can be 
                put on display on the drive mounts in the rear of the case, whereas a dedicated 
                pump/reservoir mount in the main chamber makes installation of liquid cooling equipment 
                easy. Additionally, the Alpha series is prepared for vertical GPUs with an easy mounting 
                solution in the main chamber (PCI-e riser cable sold separately) that allows for 
                hassle-free transition to a vertical GPU system.

            <h2>Alpha 550, four tempered glass panels for the ultimate RGB experience</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The Alpha 550 RGB combines the brilliance of the three included Bora 120 RGB fans and RGB 
                strip on the front panel with four tempered glass panels. Its premium looks are combined 
                by a keenness for cleanness. Alongside the front and top tempered glass panels runs a 
                first dust grill and the fan/radiator racks behind it are covered with an easily removable 
                dust mesh filter. The Alpha 550 supports larger radiators than the Alpha 330 for optimal 
                cooling. The Alpha 550 has been designed as the core for any clean build and has been 
                equipped to go all the way, no matter the circumstances.

            <h2>Alpha 330 vertical GPU and clean build chassis</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The Alpha 330 comes is the current entry model in Lian Li’s new Alpha series, but is 
                identical internally to the Alpha 550 RGB. This means you get space for a 420 mm radiator 
                at the front of the chassis and the front panel has been optimized for air flow, with two 
                large air-intakes at the top and bottom of the panel for those that prefer cooling 
                performance over. The top panel houses up to three 120 mm fans, covered with a 
                magnetically sealed dust filter and not covered with tempered glass. The main glass panel 
                is larger than on the Alpha 550 and overlaps the front cover leading to a visually sleek 
                style that defines it from any other case on the market.
